# Deepfake Video Detection System

Welcome to the **Deepfake Video Detection System**! This project leverages advanced AI and machine learning techniques to detect deepfake videos, which are AI-generated videos that manipulate or alter visual content to deceive viewers. Our goal is to help combat the spread of misinformation by providing an effective solution to identify and flag deepfakes.

## Key Features

- **AI-powered Detection**: Uses machine learning models to differentiate between authentic and deepfake videos.
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Implements convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image and video analysis.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of analyzing videos and providing detection results in near real-time.
- **High Accuracy**: Trained on a diverse dataset to achieve high detection accuracy across a range of deepfake manipulation techniques.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive platform for uploading videos and receiving detection results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For scripting and automation.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and frame extraction.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the backend.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the frontend interface.

## How It Works

1. **Upload a Video**: Users can upload a video for analysis.
2. **Frame Extraction**: The system extracts frames from the video for deepfake detection.
3. **Model Processing**: Each frame is processed through the trained AI model to detect potential deepfake manipulations.
4. **Results**: The system provides a report indicating whether the video is likely a deepfake, with a confidence score.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhinavsingh18/satyanetra.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd satyanetra
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved Model Training**: Continually expanding the dataset for better generalization.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Making the system accessible on mobile devices.
- **API**: Creating an API for third-party integration.
